Hello, we are [FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/about).

We make stuff. Beautiful, practical, meaningful stuff.  
We make what we love.  
We love what we do.

## Why

Over the years we noticed that software that's designed to help us be creative actually makes us less creative. Ideas aren't born in slide decks, documents, or image editors. They begin freeform, on paper, in conversations, as sketches.

We founded FiftyThree to build tools that work the way we do. Tools for the creative space—the 53 centimeters that magically link head, heart, and hand. Tools as simple as pencil and paper. Tools so essential, we can't imagine working without them.

## What

In March of 2012,  we launched [Paper by FiftyThree](http://www.fiftythree.com/paper), the simplest, most beautiful way to create on the iPad. Within two weeks, Paper was downloaded 1.5 million times. To date, our users have produced more than 100 million creations.

In December of 2013, Paper got a new friend named [Pencil](http://www.fiftythree.com/pencil). The Verge called it “the best iPad stylus yet”, in part because of the care our software developers put it into making it seamlessly integrate with Paper. Since launch, Pencil support has been added to a number of top-tier apps and it's consistently the top selling stylus on Amazon.

In September of 2014, we launched [Mix](http://news.fiftythree.com/post/97645975008/mix-create-together-the-english-inventor-sir), an open platform for creativity. Fast Company captured the launch well: "Mix, will be equally influential, if not even more important than Paper’s original launch. Because Mix teases an even larger, potentially more disruptive idea--an Internet that allows you to reach through a screen and manipulate multimedia at will." Since then, we've been growing the community steadily every day.

We're pleased to have received such a warm welcome, but we still have much work to do. Our ambition is no less than to change the way people create, and we're building world-class engineering teams in NYC and Seattle to take on this challenge. There are many more apps, services, and hardware products to come.

## Who

Great products begin with great people. This is who we strive to be:

* **Well-rounded** We develop products at the intersection of art and science. It's great to have depth, but breadth is essential.
* **Collaborative** Harmonious products reflect the teams that build them. The ability to work across disciplines and make others better is a must.
* **Maker** We place a high value on the quality of our products and the process of making them. The joy of making is its own reward. We consistently set a higher bar.
* **Respectful** Creativity flourishes in open, accepting environments. Respect and kindness towards members of the team and our customers is an absolute requirement.
* **Experimental** We don't shy away from risks and experimentation. We embrace new thinking and technologies and always consider multiple ways of solving problems.

## About You

We're looking for DevOps engineers to help us build automated, scalable systems that will allow [Mix](https://mix.fiftythree.com) and our other service-based products to meet demand and never leave our users without access to inspiration.

As a DevOps engineer, you'll handle operations, network and systems challenges, but with a programmer's mindset. We automate as much as we can and spend time researching the best tools for building infrastructure and supporting our dev team. We pride ourselves in adopting new technology and run a unique stack that suits our problem space well: NodeJS, Neo4j, Heroku, Ansible, AWS and more.

Positions are available on our back-end team in both our NYC (TriBeCa) and Seattle (Pioneer Square) offices. We are a growing company with a diverse range of products, so you’ll play a large part in helping shape the practices, standards, and culture at FiftyThree. We offer relocation, competitive compensation, and excellent benefits.

### Responsibilities

* Play a vital role in the development and maintenance of the web services and apps that are redefining what it means to create on mobile devices and web.
* Construct and maintain highly-robust, cost-efficient back-end services that can grow with our community, respond rapidly to spikes in demand, and anticipate future needs.
* Collaborate with the rest of the engineering team to coordinate launches, deploy new code and fixes, and make sure the infrastructure and the applications are working smoothly.
* Maintain a high level of software quality, using industry standard processes for source code management, QA and peer review.
* Work in a highly cross-discipline environment where design, product, and engineering teams come together with the common goal of creating the best possible user experience.
* Listen to the community, care about the customer, and push for addressing common issues and performance bottlenecks.

### Requirements

* Must have experience working with AWS. We use the whole playbook in addition to just managing instances and DNS: Route53, SSL, S3, SSH, CDN, etc.
* Must have a passion for automation and/or configuration management through a combination of researching and configuring best-in-class third-party tells as well as building your own.
* Must have experience with Linux, e.g. bash. 
* Should have gained extensive experience with scripting languages (e.g., Python, Perl, Ruby) in past positions.
* Experience with our specific technologies is a plus, but not a requirement: AWS, EC2, Node, Neo4j, Ansible, Splunk.
* Excellent problem solving, critical thinking, communication, and planning skills.
* Strong CS fundamentals like modularity, design patterns, DRY code, reuse of existing libraries, consistent naming.
* 2+ years professional experience
